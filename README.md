### CLI ToDo List

## Introduction
A neat little todo list for your cli, made with python!

## Installation

To get the program on your computer, you:

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone github.com/Rikemannen/todo-list
```

2. Move to the directory:

```bash
cd todo-list
```

3. Run it!

```bash
python main.py -h
```

## How to use

Really simple to use, to add a task:

```bash
python list.py -a "Empty Dishwasher"
```

But nobody likes doing that, so we delete it:

```bash
python list.py -r 1
```

or:

```bash
python list.py -r "empty"
```

The script matches both numbers, as in which order, and text.

Don't know what tasks you have?

```bash
python list.py -l
```

too much stuff...

```bash
python list.py -c
```
